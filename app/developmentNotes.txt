Time log:
    Time to setting up server, 
    and creating front-end and back-end: 5hrs
    Time spent testing and cleaning up: 30 min


How to use:
    - Inputs are accepted as string characters according to airport identifiers. 
    - Multiple inputs should be separated by spaces.
    - If a "Best Runway" is available, it will be displayed at the bottom, 
        as well as a visual indication in the form of a compass.


Assumptions made during development:
    - Occationally, the ForeFlight API will return null values for important data fields, such as wind speed or direction. 
        When this is the case, the application displays "Unavailable"
    - In order to determine if a runway is unavailable, I used the API values "rightTrafficBase" and "rightTrafficRecip" as references. 
        If both of these are False, the runway is not considered available, and thus is not extracted as valid data. There may be instances in which
        there is no runway available. In this case, there will not be a suggested "best runway", an illistration will not be displayed, and "None" will be 
        displayed as available runways on the web application.
    - Because there is no overhead images of the different airport runways, a compass is used to point in the direction of the best runway, 
        using "magneticHeading" as the needle angle. 


Areas for improvment:
    - Better documentation
    - Improve UI/UX
    - Error handling
    - Confirm what the logic is for checking if a runway is available or not
    - Figure out a way to get the wind direction more consistently, possibly using forecast data if consistent, 
        or possibly observe previous wind data by airport to see if wind patterns are typically erradic or not, 
        and thus suitable for wind direction predictions.
